## data

* [Bilateral migration](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DIOC_SECTOR) from OECD.Stat.  From the data documentation:

        The sources for this database are mainly census data, from the 2000
        round of censuses. Census data were used for 22 countries. Countries not
        taking periodic censuses but keeping population registers have provided
        data extracted from these registers; this is the case for four
        countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. 
* [Bilateral foreign aid](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DACSECTOR#)from OECD.Stat.  From the data documentation:

        Bilateral ODA commitments by purpose.

        The sectoral distribution of bilateral ODA commitments refers to the
        economic sector of destination (i.e. the specific area of the
        recipient's economic or social structure whose development is, or is
        intended to be fostered by the aid), rather than to the type of goods or
        services provided. These are aggregates of individual projects notified
        under the Creditor Reporting System, supplemented by reporting on the
        sectoral distribution of technical co-operation, and on actual
        disbursements of food and emergency aid.
